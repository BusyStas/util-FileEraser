This is a set of instructions for AI Copilot, you should read and implement them, but do not edit this file directly.


General overview:
    - you should create a desktop app that will erase files and folders from a disk
    - It should have a GUI as a Desktop app in Python
    - It should have a log file with timestamp and error description
    - It should have a config file with a list of folders to erase
    - It should have a button to start erasing
    - It should have a button to stop erasing
    - It should have a tab or space that displays the config file and allow to edit it
    - create util-FileEraser-INSTALL.bat 
    - create util-FileEraser-RUN.bat 
    

What Erasing is:
    - You should apply multiple steps and save edits between each step.
    - Step 1: Edit the content and remove i.e. 10% of the content, save the file
    - Step 2: Edit the content and replace each of remaining bytes with a random letter, save the file, save the file
    - Step 3: Edit and overwrite the content with random data (i.e. "hello world"), save the file
    - Step 4: Edit and overwrite with the empty content, save the file
    - You should not delete the file. Let the changes spread to the file system and cloud
